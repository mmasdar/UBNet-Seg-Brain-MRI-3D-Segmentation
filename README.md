# UBNet-Seg-Brain-MRI-3D-Segmentation
This GitHub repository contains the development of image segmentation methods based on UBNet-Seg architecture for segmentation of multiresolution 3D brain MRI. The repository includes code and documentation for training and evaluating models using various datasets, as well as implementation of different techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and ensemble methods to improve segmentation performance. The goal of this project is to develop robust and accurate image segmentation methods for medical imaging applications, specifically for brain MRI.
